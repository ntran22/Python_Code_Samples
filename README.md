# Python_Code_Samples

The objective of this project to be able to work across multiple tables to:

- Produce analytical data extraction files
- Populate demographic characteristic tables

We will observe patients' medication adherence to medication groups like anticoagulents, antidiabetics, and antihypertensives. Addtionally, we will produce a Naive Bayes Classifier to predict the likelihood of a patient experiencing a cardiac event, Mycardiol Infarction (MI). The model will account for conditional probabilities involving the patient's:

- Gender
- Age
- Medication adherence
- Past medical history (i.e. hypertension, cardiac arrythmia, valvular heart disease, CHF, and COPD)

The data is fully de-identified for HIPAA compliance and includes adjudicated claims from health plans for all provider types (MD, Rx, Hospital, Lab, etc.). The professor on this project required the data maniputlation and extraction to be completed with Python.
